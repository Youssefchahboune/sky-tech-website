# Website-Design-for-Drone-Company
I designed and implemented a website for an imaginary company called Sky Tech which sale drones.

## UI Design for website made on Figma

- All the pictures on the website were taken from the internet and will only be use as for project purposes
- All the icons on the website were made by me using figma.
- This will only be a one page website and some of the website's features such as learn more button won't actually work but only be done to show case my skills and what I can do.
- The color scheme of this website is a mix of blue ![#3F95C6](https://placehold.co/15x15/3F95C6/3F95C6.png) `#3F95C6` , white ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) `#FFFFFF` and black with an opacity of 50% which gives a tone of gray.
